## Bingo Cat

A smol tech days project for a little group that wants to make Bingo happen.

### How Did We Make This?

Meme Driven Development.

Beyond that, we spent 2 days slamming our keyboards to incite Ruby, Sinatra, Javascript, and Haml templates to shape a
sqlite database into a bingo serving machine.

And we would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for some dependency issues in our Dockerfile. That may get
sorted, but no promises. We had a lot of fun making it, and if you're here reading this, right now, then have a
fantastic day.

### Who Did This?

We did! Sorry, not sorry.
